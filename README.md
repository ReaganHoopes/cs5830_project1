# CS5830 Project 1

In order to run the code you will need to download the 2021 â€“ comma-delimited version [Baseball Databank] at the following link and place it in the same directory as the ipynb file: https://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics

Additionally, we obtained data the following link: from https://www.ncaa.com/history/baseball/d1 

We have included this dataset in our repo due to its small size. In order to run the code, you will need to place the 'outside_data' folder in the top level of the baseballdatabank-2022.2 directory that was downloaded above.
